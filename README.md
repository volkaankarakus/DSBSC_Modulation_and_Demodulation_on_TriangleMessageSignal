# DSBSC_Modulation_and_Demodulation_on_TriangleMessageSignal
DSBSC modulation and subsequent demodulation of a message signal by superimposing it on the carrier signal are shown.
The signal obtained as a result of demodulation was compared with the original signal, and the accuracy of the procedures was proved.
Also;
1. The frequency spectrum of the modulated signal has been examined.
2. Butterworth LPF was used for demodulation.
